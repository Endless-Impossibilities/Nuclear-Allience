#Store how much water is in (Just trust me on this). Just define 100%
#Store water varible
#Every second/tick, take water away
#Divide how much water you have by the capacity
#Now you has percentage
#Multiply percentage by the max amount of pixels
#Then you set the hight

#Store the water as 100%
var water = 100

#Ticks? I'm just a tad confussed here... I'm still a bit new to gdscript and I couldn't really find
#any thing about it.



# Declare member variables here. Examples:
# var a = 2
# var b = "text"


# Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
func _ready():
	pass # Replace with function body.
	


# Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame.
#func _process(delta):
#	pass
